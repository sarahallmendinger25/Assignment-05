            <p>My dog Judge, according to his DNA test,is half Bloodhound and half various other large breeds of dogs. He has a gorgeous brindle coat, a charming droopy face, and a personality that will make anyone fall in love with him.</p><br>
            <p>His full registered name, as listed on his microchip, is "Judge Dredd Starring Sylvester Stallone".</p>
            <p>We call him various other affectionate names in our day-to-day life. These names include, "Sweet Boy", "Little Guy", "Mr. Dredd", and "Buddy".</p><br>
            <p>At the age of four, he weighs roughly (ruff-ly) 130lbs and requires six cups of kibble a day. When you're a helicopter dog mom, wanting only the best for your fur baby, you spend just as much on dog food as you do on people food.</p><br>
            <p>Even though he looks big and scary, he's a giant baby and loves nothing more than to snuggle up on a lap and get attention from his friends. He's also incredibly jealous and whines if another dog is getting attention in front of him. He will push his way between the person and the other dog to reclaim his spot as The Most Important Dog&#8482;.</p>
